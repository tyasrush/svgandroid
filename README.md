his is a compact and straightforward library for parsing SVG files and rendering them in an Android Canvas. By using vector art, the pain of supporting various screen sizes and densities in Android can be reduced. This was the library used to render the artwork and the interface of Androidify.  The project also includes a Live Wallpaper app extracted from Androidify. The app shows off the SVG library, and demonstrates the rendering pipeline used to draw the Androids.
